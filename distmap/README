About
=====
These files represent the association between gentoo packages and upstream CPAN
Distribution names.

The general format is JSON, and the data it represents is like this::


    {
        'overlay-name': {
            'cpan-name' : 'gentoo-package-name'
            ....
        }
    }

The `overlay-name` is taken from `$ROOT/profiles/repo_name`,
and for each package ( `gentoo-package-name` ), an identifier relating to an
upsteam CPAN distribution is determined ( `cpan-name` ) from reading
`metadata.xml` and extracting `/pkgmeta/upstream/remote-id[type=cpan]` from it.

This is of course not guaranteed to be reliable to produce all the cpan-names
for all packages we have, but thats an acceptable caveat.

Format wise, its permissible to have multiple `overlay-name`'s in the same
file, representing multiple graphs for multiple repositories.

Do note however, that the intended usage of these files in the `distmap`
directory is to aggregate their values into a singular `Hash` prior to usage,
so if 2 files emit the same `overlay-name`, one will likely take precidence (
or possibly produce an error, the code doesn't exist yet.
